## ssspeed!

`ssspeed!` is a clean, focused GPS speedometer and trip tracker for people who care about **real speed** and **simple stats**, not bloated dashboards.

The app shows your current speed with big, readable digits, logs your distance and time, and keeps a neat history of your rides. It works great for driving, cycling, scooters, skiing, or just walking around and checking how fast you actually move.

### Why it’s awesome

  Big digital speed readout that’s easy to see at a glance.

- **km/h and mph**  
  Switch units instantly to match your habits or the country you’re in.

- **Ride history**  
  See distance, duration, and max speed for each trip in a clean list.

- **Smart GPS filtering**  
  Filters out unrealistic GPS spikes so your stats stay believable.

- **High‑accuracy mode**  
  Optional mode for more stable measurements when you really care about precision.

- **Lock Screen & Dynamic Island (iOS)**  
  Live Activity with speed and trip progress right on your Lock Screen / Dynamic Island.

  Keep recording even when the screen is off or you switch apps.

- **Cross‑platform**  
  Native apps for **iOS** and **Android**, with consistent design and behavior.

### How to use it

1. **Pick your activity**  
   Open the app, choose how you’re moving (car, bike, walk, scooter, etc.).

2. **Wait for GPS**  
   Give the app a moment to lock onto GPS. The banner at the top will tell you when the signal is good enough.

3. **Start your ride**  
   Tap **Start**. You’ll see:
   - Current speed
   - Trip duration
   - Distance
   - Max speed

4. **Pause / resume / finish**  
   - Tap **Pause** if you stop for a while.  
   - Tap **Resume** to keep going.  
   - Tap **Finish** to save the ride into history.

5. **Review your trips**  
   Open **History** to see previous rides, check stats, and drill into details like max speed and duration.

### Subscription & free trial

`ssspeed!` has a simple premium model:

- **3‑day free trial** to record and save your tracks.
- After the trial, a **weekly subscription** unlocks unlimited ride recording and history.
- You can cancel anytime in system Settings; subscriptions auto‑renew unless cancelled.

The app still shows your live speed even if you’re not subscribed — the subscription is for **saving and reviewing** your rides.

### Privacy & data

`ssspeed!` uses your location **only** to:

- Calculate current speed  
- Measure distance and duration  
- Record tracks for your ride history (if enabled)

Location data is not used for advertising, is not sold to third parties, and is only stored locally for your ride history unless you explicitly export or back it up yourself.

You stay in control: you can revoke location access at any time in system Settings.

### Platforms & requirements

- **iOS**: Requires iOS 17+ (Live Activities / Dynamic Island features where supported).  
- **Android**: Requires a reasonably recent Android device with GPS.

For the best experience:

- Use the app outdoors with a clear view of the sky.  
- Keep your device stable (e.g. on a mount in your car or on your bike).  
- Enable high‑accuracy GPS if you want smoother stats (with slightly higher battery usage).
